This is a basic port of the gnuserv suite, originally by
Andy Norman et al. The NT/Win95 implementation uses mailslots,
and under NT relies on NT's built-in security for access control.

Because shells on NT vary widely as to how they interpret 
special characters like quotes and parentheses, I have
added a debug flag (-d) to gnudoit and gnuclient. Use this
to display the lisp code that is sent to the gnuserv process.

Basic installation:

* Put the gnuserv.el program on your load-path and byte compile 
it. Add the following lines to your emacs intialization file
(_emacs on NT):

  (require 'gnuserv)
  (gnuserv-start)

* Make sure the gnuserv program is somewhere that emacs can find it.
(eg, on your PATH or in the emacs bin directory). Make sure the gnudoit 
and gnuclient programs are accessible from your shell.

Besides using gnuclient and gnudoit from the command-line, you can
also use gnuclient for some File Associations. It beats the heck out
of Notepad :)

---------

gnuclient.c is now compiled as console program (gnuclient.exe, same
name as before) and as windows program (gnuclientw.exe).

The windows version will force the -q (quick) flag on and is ideal to
be used with the Explorer's file-type association.  It will not open a
console window like gnuclient.exe.

It is also possible to drag files on the gnuclientw.exe program, or a
shortcut to the program (placed on your desktop e.g.), to
"drag-n-drop" a file into Emacs.

Also, gnuclient and gnudoit will now try to start Emacs if they cannot
connect to gnuserv's mailslot.  They do this by launching 'runemacs.exe'
and then waiting for up to 30 seconds for the gnuserv mailslot to
appear.  Make sure the emacs-19.xx\bin directory is in your path for
this to work.


7-Oct-96
--------

gnuclientw.exe and gnuclient.exe will now explicitly look up the long
filename of the file they are passed as an argument (Windows does not
seem to pass long filenames to shortcuts).


11-Oct-96
---------

Fixed small bug in new long filename code.  gnuclient was no longer
accepting filenames of files that don't exist.


13-Jan-97
---------

Incorporated small fix suggested by William Sobel.  gnuclient(w) will
now make sure the path uses a lowercase drive letter before sending it
to Emacs.  Emacs will then no longer consider files opened manually to
be different than when they are opened with gnuclient(w).  Needs a
better fix in gnuserv.el or perhaps even Emacs itself, but this "hack"
helps to make this less of a problem :)


27-Feb-97
---------

Fixed small bug in gnuserv that could send it into a 100% CPU time
consuming loop.  This very rarely happened (when the Emacs process was
killed e.g.), but now gnuserv will put up a message box informing the
user of the abnormal error and will then quit.

Added two new options to gnuclient and gnuclientw (-f and -F).  The -f
option will pop the Emacs window to the front, as long as Emacs was
not iconified.  The -F option will _always_ pop the Emacs window to
the front, uniconifying it if needed.

Major code cleanup (especially in gnuclient/gnudoit).  Note that most
source files are .cpp files now.  Starting gnuclient(w) or gnudoit
without argument no longer causes problems (the program fails and
usage will be printed to the console).

Added version strings to all .EXE files to help people better identify
what version of these tools they are running.  gnuclient/gnudoit will
print the version information as part of the usage output.
