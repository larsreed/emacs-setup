;;; Commentary:

;; This file is necessary in order to run CC Mode 5 under Emacs 19.34
;; Do *not* load this file if you are using XEmacs 19.15, Emacs 20 or
;; XEmacs 20!

;; To conditionally load this only in Emacs 19.34, add the following
;; to your .emacs file, *before* you load CC Mode.

;;     (require 'cc-mode-19))

;;; Code:


(require 'advice)

;; Emacs 19.34 requires the POS argument to char-after.  Emacs 20
;; makes it optional, as it has long been in XEmacs.

;; Emacs 19.34 doesn't have a char-before function.  Here's it's Emacs
;; 20 definition.

      (if (not pos)
	  (setq pos (point)))
