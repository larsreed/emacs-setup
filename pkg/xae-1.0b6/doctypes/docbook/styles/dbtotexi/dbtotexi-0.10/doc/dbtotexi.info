Introduction
============

   This document describes `dbtotexi', a simple utility for converting
XML documents that conform to a subset of the DocBook DTD into GNU
texinfo format. The `dbtotexi' program is implemented using the XSL
Transformations language as described in the working document
`http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-xslt-19990421'. A Java based XSL
engine(1) carries out the actual transformation as determined by the
style sheet `dbtotexi.xsl'. A small amount of additional Java code
provides a few utility routines not provided by the XSL implementation.

Installation
============

   Once the tar archive has been unpacked(1), check the `Makefile' to
see if the settings at the top are suitable for your site and then just
type `make' and `make install'. By default, the `dbtotexi' bash shell
script goes into `/usr/local/bin' and the support files into
`/usr/local/share/dbtotexi'. A compiled version of the Java support
code is supplied so that you do not need a Java compiler unless you
change the Java code.

   The installation defaults to using Sun's `jre' VM but any JDK 1.1
compliant implementation (such as Kaffe(2)) should work. No GUI
facilities or additional libraries are required. If you use a different
VM then the shell script, `dbtotexi.sh' may need editing.

Usage
=====

   A DocBook source file, `foo.xml', is converted to texinfo format
very simply:

     dbtotexi foo.xml

   Will produce output in `foo.texinfo'. The name of the output file
can be explicitly specified as a second argument. If the output file
name is specified as `-', the output is sent to stdout. A third
argument will specify the name of the info file to produce, this
defaults to the input file name modified to have a `.info' suffix. Any
DocBook elements that are not recognised (due to either an error in the
input document or because the translator does not yet support a
translation for that element) are reported to stderr and shown in the
output in bold.

   A document that conforms to the SGML DocBook DTD must first be
converted to XML before it can be processed by `dbtotexi'. This can be
done using the `sx' program that is part of James Clark's `SP' SGML
toolset. Typical usage would be:

     sx -xlower foo.sgm > foo.xml



Note
....

     The XML version of the DocBook DTD is not actually required by the
conversion process (but see *Note sec_texinfopi::). In fact, if the
document to be converted doesn't contain a `DOCTYPE' declaration then
the conversion process is somewhat quicker. Irrespective of whether the
document contains a `DOCTYPE' declaration, it should be valid (i.e. it
conforms to the DocBook XML DTD).

Role Attributes
===============

   This section describes how the translation of some the elements are
influenced by the setting of the element's `role' attribute.

`indexterm'
     The `role' attribute can be set to one of `c', `f', `v', `k', `p'
     and `d' to indicate which index the entry should be entered in. If
     the `role' attribute is not specified the entry will be entered
     into the concept index by default.

`index'
     The `role' attribute can be set to one of `c', `f', `v', `k', `p'
     and `d' to indicate which index should be output. If the `role'
     attribute is not specified the concept index will be output by
     default.

`variablelist'
     The `role' attribute can be set to one of `bold' or `fixed' to
     indicate that the list's terms should be displayed in bold or
     fixed-width font respectively. If the `role' attribute is not
     specified, the list's terms be displayed "as is".

The `texinfo' Processing Instruction
====================================

   The `texinfo' processing instruction can be used within a document
to insert arbitrary markup into the output. The characters `@', `{' and
`}' are not escaped. This facility can be used to define entities that
contain texinfo markup. For example, given that the following general
entity declaration is placed in the DTD subset:

     <!ENTITY hellip "<?texinfo @dots{}?>">

   One can write `&hellip;' and expect to get dots...!

The `dircategory' & `direntry' Processing Instructions
======================================================

   The `dircategory' and `direntry' processing instructions may be used
to set the resulting info file's directory category and menu entry.
These processing instructions are best positioned after the document
type declaration but before the first element (`<book>' or
`<article>'). Here's what this document uses:

     <?dircategory Texinfo documentation system?>
     <?direntry * Dbtotexi: (dbtotexi). DocBook to Texinfo convertor.?>

Support for Unicode Characters
==============================

   A few Unicode characters are recognised in element content and
converted into the equivalent texinfo command. Unrecognised Unicode
characters are passed through unchanged. Norman Walsh's DocBook XML DTD
defines the ISO entity set in terms of Unicode characters. *Note
app_unicode:: lists the set of Unicode characters that are currently
recognised.

Caveats
=======

   A couple of points should be born in mind:

  1. Only a small subset of the DocBook DTD has currently been
     implemented. Furthermore, of the elements that have been
     implemented, most of their attributes are ignored. As time goes
     by, the implementation will become more complete. However, some
     features of DocBook may never be implemented due to limitatations
     in the texinfo format and some features of DocBook may never be
     implemented because they are not considered useful enough. All
     contributions are welcome. Please send contributions and bug
     reports to <markb@ordern.com>.

  2. The XSL Transformations language has not yet been standardised
     and, therefore, applications that use it are subject to change. I
     envisage having to modify the XSL script to track the development
     of XSL and its implementations.

  3. It is possible that some existing SGML documents may require
     modification before they can be successfully converted to XML and
     hence into texinfo.
