
This package provides dbtotexi, a command line utility for converting
XML documents that conform to the DocBook DTD into GNU Texinfo format.

It requires a working Java VM like 'kaffe' or 'jre' to execute the
translator engine.

Installation is just 'make install' and 'make install-doc'. Obviously,
take a look at the Makefile first.

Please see 'doc/dbtotexi.info' or 'doc/dbtotexi.dvi' for further
instructions.

This release only provides the absolute minimum of functionality, just
about enough to translate its own documentation!

Any reasonable code contributions will be gratefully accepted.
