This chapter is intended to provide a quick introduction to structured
markup (<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
>). If you're already familiar with <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> or
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
>, you only need to skim this chapter.</P
><P
>To work with DocBook, you need to understand a few basic concepts of
structured editing in general, and DocBook, in particular. That's
covered here. You also need some concrete experience with the way a
DocBook document is structured. That's covered in the next chapter.</P

This chapter doesn't assume that you know what <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>HTML</SPAN
> is, but if you
do, you have a starting point for understanding structured
markup. <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>HTML</SPAN
> (Hypertext Markup Language) is a way of marking up text
and graphics so that the most popular web browsers can interpret
them. <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>HTML</SPAN
> consists of a set of markup tags with specific
meanings. Moreover, <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>HTML</SPAN
> is a very basic type of <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> markup that
is easy to learn and easy for computer applications to generate. But
the simplicity of <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>HTML</SPAN
> is both its virtue and its weakness. Because
of <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>HTML</SPAN
>'s limitations, web users and programmers have had to extend
and enhance it by a series of customizations and revisions that still
fall short of accommodating current, to say nothing of future, needs.</P
><P
>&#13;
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
>, on the other hand, is an international standard that describes
how markup languages are defined. <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> does not consist of
particular tags or the rules for their usage. <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>HTML</SPAN
> is an example of
a markup language defined in <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
>.</P

<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
> promises an intelligent improvement over <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>HTML</SPAN
>, and
compatibility with it is already being built into the most popular web
browsers. <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
> is not a new markup language designed to compete with
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>HTML</SPAN
>, and it's not designed to create conversion headaches for people
with tons of <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>HTML</SPAN
> documents. <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
> is intended to alleviate
compatibility problems with browser software; it's a new, easier
version of the standard rules that govern the markup itself, or, in
other words, a new version of <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
>. The rules of <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
> are designed
to make it easier to write both applications that interpret its type
of markup and applications that generate its markup. <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
> was
developed by a team of <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> experts who understood and sought to
correct the problems of learning and implementing <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
>. <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
> is
also <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>extensible</I
> markup, which means that it is
customizable. A browser or word processor that is <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
>-capable will
be able to read any <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
>-based markup language that an individual
user defines.</P
><P
>In this book, we tend to describe things in terms of <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
>, but where
there are differences between <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
> (and there are only a
few), we point them out. For our purposes, it doesn't really matter
whether you use <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN

CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>During the coming months, we anticipate that <SPAN

and other tools will become available. Nevertheless, it's not
unreasonable to do your authoring in <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> and your online publishing
in <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN

your authoring in <SPAN

An essential characteristic of structured markup is that it explicitly
distinguishes (and accordingly "marks up" within a
document) the structure and semantic content of a document. It does
not mark up the way in which the document will appear to the reader,
in print or otherwise.</P
><P
>In the days before word processors it was common for a typed
manuscript to be submitted to a publisher. The manuscript identified
the logical structures of the documents (chapters, section titles, and
so on), but said nothing about its appearance. Working independently
of the author, a designer then developed a specification for the
appearance of the document, and a typesetter marked up and applied the
designer's format to the document.</P
><P
><A
NAME="AEN378"
></A
>
<A
NAME="AEN381"
></A
>

Because presentation or appearance is usually based on structure and
content, <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> markup logically precedes and generally determines the
way a document will look to a reader. If you are familiar with strict,
simple <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>HTML</SPAN
> markup, you know that a given document that is
structurally the same can also look different on different
computers. That's because the markup does not specify many aspects of
a document's appearance, although it does specify many aspects of a
document's structure.</P
><P
><A

Many writers type their text into a word processor, line-by-line and
word-for-word, italicizing technical terms, underlining words for
emphasis, or setting section headers in a font complementary to the
body text, and finally, setting the headers off with a few carriage
returns fore and aft. The format such a writer imposes on the words on
the screen imparts structure to the document by changing its
appearance in ways that a reader can more or less reliably decode.
The reliability depends on how consistently and unambiguously the
changes in type and layout are made. By contrast, an <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
>/<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
>
markup of a section header explicitly specifies that a specific piece
of text is a section header. This assertion does not specify the
presentation or appearance of the section header, but it makes the
fact that the text is a section header completely unambiguous.</P

In an <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> document, there is no obligatory difference between the
size or face of the type in a first-level section header and the title
of a book in a footnote or the first sentence of a body paragraph. All
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> files are simple text files without font changes or special
characters.<A
NAME="AEN460"
HREF="#FTN.AEN460"
>[1]</A
> Similarly, an <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> document
does not specify the words in a text that are to be set in italic,
bold, or roman type. Instead, <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> marks certain kinds of texts for
their semantic content. For example, if a particular word is the name
of a file, then the tags around it should specify that it is a
filename:</P

CLASS="SGMLTAG"

If the meaning of a phrase is particularly audacious, it might get
tagged for boldness of thought instead of appearance. An <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
>
document contains all the information that a typesetter needs to lay
out and typeset a printed page in the most effective and consistent
way, but it does not specify the layout or the
type.<A

Not only is the structure of an <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
>/<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
> document explicit, but it
is also carefully controlled. An <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> document makes reference to a
set of declarations--a document type definition
(<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
>)--that contains an inventory of tag names and specifies
the combination rules for the various structural and semantic features
that make up a document. What the distinctive features are and how
they should be combined is "arbitrary" in the sense that
almost any selection of features and rules of composition is
theoretically possible. The DocBook <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
> chooses a particular set of
features and rules for its users.</P
><P
><A
NAME="AEN526"
></A
>
Here is a specific example of how the DocBook <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
> works. DocBook
specifies that a third-level section can follow a second-level section
but cannot follow a first-level section without an intervening
second-level section.</P

Because an <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
>/<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
> document has an associated <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
> that
describes the valid, logical structures of the document, you can test
the logical structure of any particular document against the
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
>. This process is performed by a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>parser</I
>. An
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> processor must begin by parsing the document and determining if
it is valid, that is, if it conforms to the rules specified in the
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
>. <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
> processors are not required to
check for validity, but it's always a good idea to check for validity
when authoring. Because you can test and validate the
structure of an <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
>/<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
> document with software, a DocBook
document containing a first-level section followed immediately by a
third-level section will be identified as invalid, meaning that it's
not a valid <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>instance</I
> or example of a document
defined by the DocBook <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
>. Presumably, a document with a logical
structure won't normally jump from a first- to a third-level section,
so the rule is a safeguard--but not a guarantee--of good
writing, or at the very least, reasonable structure. A parser also
verifies that the names of the tags are correct and that tags
requiring an ending tag have them. This means that a valid document is
also one that should format correctly, without runs of paragraphs
incorrectly appearing in bold type or similar monstrosities that
everyone has seen in print at one time or another. For more

>In general, adherence to the explicit rules of structure and markup in

versatility also frees the author to concentrate on the document
content. For example, as we write this book, we don't know exactly how
O'Reilly will choose to present chapter headings, bulleted lists,
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> terms, or any of the other semantic features. And we don't
care. It's irrelevant; whatever presentation is chosen, the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
>
sources will be transformed automatically into that style.</P
><P
>Semantic markup can relieve the author of other, more significant
burdens as well (after all, careful use of paragraph and character
styles in a word processor document theoretically allows us to change
the presentation independently from the document). Using semantic
markup opens up your documents to a world of possibilities. Documents
become, in a loose sense, databases of information. Programs can
compile, retrieve, and otherwise manipulate the documents in
predictable, useful ways.</P

say, <SPAN

structural markup, because you can convert its documents with ease
into other presentational forms, and search them more precisely. If
you start with <SPAN

DocBook's, your versatility and searchability is substantially
restricted and cannot be improved.</P

with a typical word processor, and change is difficult. In particular,
authors don't like giving up control over the appearance of their
words especially now that they have acquired it with the advent of
word processors. But many publishing companies need authors to
relinquish that control, because book design and production remains
their job, not their authors'.</P

been speaking about most, like <A
HREF="sect1.html"
><TT
CLASS="SGMLTAG"
>sect1</TT

a document's content and structure. Most elements come in pairs and
mark the start and end of the construct they surround--for
example, the <SPAN

<TT

CLASS="SGMLTAG"
>&#60;/para&#62;</TT

"empty" (such as DocBook's cross-reference element,
<TT

Elements can, but don't necessarily, include one or more attributes,
which are additional terms that extend the function or refine the
content of a given element. For instance, in DocBook a <TT
CLASS="SGMLTAG"
><NOBR
>&#60;sect1&#62;</NOBR
></TT
> start tag can contain an
identifier--an <SPAN
CLASS="SGMLTAG"
>id</SPAN
>
attribute--that will ultimately allow the writer to
cross-reference it or enable a reader to retrieve it. End tags cannot
contain attributes. A <TT
CLASS="SGMLTAG"
><NOBR
>&#60;sect1&#62;</NOBR
></TT
>
element with an <SPAN
CLASS="SGMLTAG"
>id</SPAN
> attribute
looks like this:</P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>&lt;sect1 id="<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I

In <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
>, the catalog of attributes that can occur on an element is
predefined. You cannot add arbitrary attribute names to an
element. Similarly, the values allowed for each attribute are
predefined. In <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
>, the use of <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/"

there's no way to perform validation on those attributes.</P

<A

The <SPAN
CLASS="SGMLTAG"
>id</SPAN
> attribute is one half of a
cross reference. An <SPAN
CLASS="SGMLTAG"
>idref</SPAN
>
attribute on another element, for example <TT
CLASS="SGMLTAG"
><NOBR
>&#60;xref linkend="idvalue"&#62;</NOBR
></TT
>, provides the other half. These attributes provide whatever
application might process the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN

either to make a hypertext link or to substitute a named and/or numbered cross
reference in place of the <TT
CLASS="SGMLTAG"
><NOBR
>&#60;xref&#62;</NOBR
></TT
>. Another use for attributes is to specify subclasses of
certain elements. For instance, you can subdivide DocBook's <TT

><NOBR
>&#60;systemitem&#62;</NOBR
></TT

CLASS="ACRONYM"

Entities are a fundamental concept in <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
>, and can be
somewhat daunting at first. They serve a number of related, but
slightly different functions, and this makes them a little bit
complicated.</P
><P
>In the most general terms, entities allow you to assign a name to some
chunk of data, and use that name to refer to that data. The complexity
arises because there are two different contexts in which you can use
entities (in the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
> and in your documents), two types of entities
(parsed and unparsed), and two or three different ways in which the
entities can point to the chunk of data that they name.</P
><P
>In the rest of this section, we'll describe each of the commonly
encountered entity types. If you find the material in this section
confusing, feel free to skip over it now and come back to it later.
We'll refer to the different types of entities as the need arises in
our discussion of DocBook. Come back to this section when you're
looking for more detail.</P
><P
>Entities can be divided into two broad categories, <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>general
entities</I
> and <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>parameter entities</I
>.
Parameter entities are most often used in the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
>, not in documents,
so we'll describe them last. Before you can use any type of entity, it
must be formally declared. This is typically done in the document
prologue, as we'll explain in <A
HREF="ch02.html"
>Chapter 2</A
>, but we will
show you how to declare each of the entities discussed here.</P

In use, general entities are introduced with an ampersand (&amp;) and end with
a semicolon (;). Within the category of general entities, there are
two types: <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>internal general entities</I
> and
<I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>external general entities</I
>.</P

<A
NAME="AEN771"

>
<A
NAME="AEN774"
></A
>

With internal entities, you can associate an essentially arbitrary
piece of text (which may have other markup, including references to
other entities) with a name. You can then include that text by
referring to its name. For example, if your document frequently refers
to, say, "O'Reilly &amp; Associates," you might declare it
as an entity:</P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>&#60;!ENTITY ora "O'Reilly &#38;amp; Associates"&#62;</PRE
><P
>Then, instead of typing it out each time, you can insert it as needed
in your document with the entity reference <TT
CLASS="SGMLTAG"
>&#38;ora;</TT
>, simply to save time. Note that this
entity declaration includes another entity reference within it.
That's perfectly valid as long as the reference isn't directly or
indirectly recursive.</P
><P
><A
NAME="AEN781"
></A
>

If you find that you use a number of entities across many documents,
you can add them directly to the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
> and avoid having to include the
declarations in each document. See the discussion of
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>dbgenent.mod</TT

HREF="ch05.html"
>Chapter 5</A

With external entities, you can reference other documents from within
your document. If these entities contain document text (<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> or
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
>), then references to them cause the parser to insert the text of
the external file directly into your document (these are called parsed
entities). In this way, you can use entities to divide your single,
logical document into physically distinct chunks. For example, you
might break your document into four chapters and store them in
separate files. At the top of your document, you would include entity
declarations to reference the four files:</P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>&#60;!ENTITY ch01 SYSTEM "ch01.sgm"&#62;
&#60;!ENTITY ch02 SYSTEM "ch02.sgm"&#62;
&#60;!ENTITY ch03 SYSTEM "ch03.sgm"&#62;
&#60;!ENTITY ch04 SYSTEM "ch04.sgm"&#62;</PRE
><P
>Your <A
HREF="book.html"
><TT
CLASS="SGMLTAG"
>Book</TT
></A
> now consists simply of references to the
entities:</P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>&lt;book&gt;
&amp;ch01;
&amp;ch02;
&amp;ch03;
&amp;ch04;
&lt;/book&gt;</PRE
><P
><A
NAME="AEN808"
></A
>
<A
NAME="AEN810"
></A
>

Sometimes it's useful to reference external files that don't contain
document text. For example, you might want to reference an external
graphic. You can do this with entities by declaring the type of data
that's in the entity using a notation (these are called unparsed
entities). For example, the following declaration declares the entity
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tree</TT
> as an encapsulated PostScript image:</P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>&#60;!ENTITY tree SYSTEM "tree.eps" NDATA EPS&#62;</PRE
><P
><A
NAME="AEN815"
></A
>

Entities declared this way cannot be inserted directly into your
document. Instead, they must be used as entity attributes to elements:</P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>&#60;graphic entityref="tree"&#62;&#60;/graphic&#62;</PRE
><P
>Conversely, you cannot use entities declared without a notation as the
value of an entity attribute.</P

<A

In order for the parser to recognize markup in your document, it must
be able to distinguish markup from content. It does this with two
special characters: "&lt;," which identifies the beginning
of a start or end tag, and "&amp;," which identifies the
beginning of an entity reference.<A
NAME="AEN832"
HREF="#FTN.AEN832"
>[4]</A
>
If you want these characters to have their literal value, they must be
encoded as entity references in your document. The entity reference
<TT
CLASS="SGMLTAG"
>&#38;lt;</TT
> produces a left angle bracket;
<TT
CLASS="SGMLTAG"
>&#38;amp;</TT

If you do not encode each of these as their respective entity
references, then an <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> parser or application is likely to
interpret them as characters introducing elements or entities (an
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
> parser will always interpret them this way); consequently, they
won't appear as you intended. If you wish to cite text that contains
literal ampersands and less-than signs, you need to transform these
two characters into entity references before they are included in a
DocBook document. The only other alternative is to incorporate text
that includes them in your document through some process that avoids
the parser.</P

numeric character references. Numeric character references resemble

Character entities are also used to give a name to special characters
that can't otherwise be typed or are not portable across applications
and operating systems. You can then include these characters in your
document by refering to their entity name. Instead of using the often
obscure and inconsistent key combinations of your particular word
processor to type, say, an uppercase letter U with an umlaut (&Uuml;),
you type in an entity for it instead. For instance, the entity for an
uppercase letter U with an umlaut has been defined as the entity
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Uuml</TT
>, so you would type in <TT
CLASS="SGMLTAG"
>&#38;Uuml;</TT
> to reference it instead of the actual
character. The <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN

document for presentation will match the entity to your platform's
handling of special characters in order to render it
appropriately.</P

DocBook is a very popular set of tags for describing books, articles,
and other prose documents, particularly technical
documentation. DocBook is defined using the native <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
> syntax of
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
>. Like <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>HTML</SPAN
>, DocBook is an example of a markup
language defined in <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN

CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN

>DocBook is almost 10 years old. It began in 1991 as a joint project of
HaL Computer Systems and O'Reilly. Its popularity grew, and eventually
it spawned its own maintainance organization, the Davenport Group. In
mid-1998, it became a Technical Committee (<SPAN

the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information

The DocBook <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
> was originally designed and implemented by HaL
Computer Systems and O'Reilly &amp; Associates around 1991. It was
developed primarily to facilitate the exchange of <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>UNIX</SPAN
> documentation
originally marked up in <I
CLASS="COMMAND"
>troff</I
>. Its design appears
to have been based partly on input from <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> interchange projects
conducted by the Unix International and Open Software Foundation
consortia.</P

When DocBook <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>V1.1</SPAN
> was published, discussion about
its revision and maintenance began in earnest in the Davenport Group,
a forum created by O'Reilly for computer documentation
producers. Version 1.2 was influenced strongly by
Novell and Digital.</P
><P
>In 1994, the Davenport Group became an officially chartered entity
responsible for DocBook's maintenance. DocBook
<SPAN

sponsors of this incarnation of Davenport include the following

widen its scope. It was now being used by a much wider audience, and

In order to help users manage change, the new Davenport charter established
the following rules for DocBook releases:
<P

><P
>Minor versions (<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"point releases"</SPAN
> such as
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>V2.2</SPAN
>) could add to the markup model, but could not
change it in a backward-incompatible way. For example, a new kind of
list element could be added, but it would not be acceptable for the
existing itemized-list model to start requiring two list items inside
it instead of only one. Thus, any document conforming to version
<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>n</I
></TT
>.0 would also conform to
<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I

></LI
><LI
><P
>Major versions (such as <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>V3.0</SPAN

both add to the markup model and make backward-incompatible
changes. However, the changes would have to be announced in the last
major release.</P

least a year.</P

<A

<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>V3.0</SPAN

although DocBook's audience continued to grow, many of the Davenport
Group stalwarts became involved in the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
> effort, and development
slowed dramatically. The idea of creating an official <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
>-compliant
version of DocBook was discussed, but not implemented. (For more
detailed information about DocBook <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"

The sponsors wanted to close out Davenport in an orderly way to ensure
that DocBook users would be supported. It was suggested that
<SPAN

<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"

July, 1998, with Eduardo Gutentag of Sun Microsystems as chair.</P
