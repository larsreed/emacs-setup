>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels.
Distinctive covers complement our distinctive approach to
technical topics, breathing personality and life into
potentially dry subjects.</P

>Edie Freedman designed the cover of this book, using a
19th-century engraving from the Dover Pictorial Archive. The
cover layout was produced by Kathleen Wilson using QuarkXPress
3.32 and Adobe's ITC Garamond font. The inside layout was
designed by Alicia Cech, based on a series design by Nancy
Priest. The text was formatted from SGML into FrameMaker 5.5
with Jade, using a DSSSL conversion stylesheet written by
Chris Maden. The interior fonts are ITC Garamond Light,
Garamond Book, and ConstantWillison.</P
><P
>Whenever possible, our books use RepKover(TM), a durable and
flexible lay-flat binding. If the page count exceeds RepKover's
limit, perfect binding is used.</P
><P
>The illustrations that appear in this book were produced by
Robert Romano using Macromedia Freehand 8 and Adobe Photoshop
5. David Futato was the production editor; Madeleine Newell guided
the book through the early stages of production.
Mark Nigara was the copyeditor for DocBook: The Definitive Guide.
Claire LeBlanc was the production manager. Ellie Cutler was the
proofreader; quality assurance was provided by Jeff Holcomb and
Claire LeBlanc. This colophon was written by Nicole Arigo.</P
