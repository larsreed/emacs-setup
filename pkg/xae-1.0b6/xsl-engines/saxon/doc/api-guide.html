<h2>Introduction</h2>
</a>

<p><b>This document describes how to use SAXON as a Java class library, without making any use
of XSLT stylesheets. If you want to know how to control stylesheet processing from a Java
application, see <a href="using-xsl.html">using-xsl.html</a>.</b></p>

<p><i>Note: The Java API was provided in SAXON long before the XSL interface. Most of the things
that the Java API was designed to do can now be done more conveniently in XSL. Reflecting this,
some of the features of the API have been withdrawn as redundant, and the focus in SAXON will
increasingly be on doing everything possible through XSL.</i></p>

<p>The Java processing model in SAXON is an extension of the XSL processing model:</p>

<ul>
<li>You write handlers for elements and other nodes in the
 document.</li>
<li>You define the rules that associate a particular handler with particular elements or
other nodes. These rules are expressed as XSL-compatible patterns. The node handlers are
analogous to XSL templates.</li>
<li>Within a node handler, you can select other nodes (typically but not necessarily
the immediate children) for processing. The system will automatically invoke the appropriate
handler for each selected node. Alternatively, you can use SAXON API calls to navigate directly
to other nodes in the document.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can process some elements in Java and others in XSLT if you wish.<p>

<p><i>The library of standard node handlers issued with previous versions of Saxon is no longer
available. These handlers all performed tasks that are done much more easily using XSLT directly.</i></p>

<p>When a Java node handler is invoked, it is provided with information about the node via
a <b>NodeInfo</b> object (usually you will be processing element nodes, in which case the
NodeInfo will be an <b>ElementInfo</b> object). The node handler is also given information
about the processing context, and access to a wide range of processing services, via a
<b>Context</b> object.</P>

<p>The NodeInfo implements the DOM Node interface, allowing navigation around the tree.
It also provides facilities to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>determine the node's name, string-value, and attributes as defined in the XPath tree model</li>
  <li>associate user data with a node for the duration of the current session</li>
  <li>copy the node to the result tree</li>
</ul>

<p>The Context object allows the node handler to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>access any parameters associated with the applyTemplates() call that invoked this
    node handler</li>
    <li>get information about the current node list (the list of nodes being processed by this
    handler: for example, to determine if this is the last node in the list)</li>
    <li>get rapid access to nodes based on registered keys and identifiers</li>
    <li>declare and reference variables</li>
    <li>set an output destination for output from this node or its children (useful when
    splitting an XML document heirarchically) </li>
    <li>write output to the current destination </li>
</ul>
    

<h3>SAXON: comparison with SAX and DOM</h3>

<p>There are two standard APIs for processing XML documents: the SAX interface, and the DOM. SAX 
 (see <a HREF="http://www.megginson.com/SAX/index.html">http://www.megginson.com/SAX/index.html</a>)
is an event-driven interface in which the parser reports things such as start and end tags to the
 application as they are encountered, while the Document Object Model (DOM) (see 
<a HREF="http://www.w3.org/dom">http://www.w3.org/dom</a>
is a navigational interface in which the application
can roam over the document in memory by following relationships between its nodes.</p>

<p>SAXON offers a higher-level processing model than either SAX or DOM. It allows applications
to be written using a rule-based design pattern, in which your application consists of a set of rules
of the form "when this condition is encountered, do this processing". It is an event-condition-action
model in which the events are the syntactic constructs of XML, the conditions are XSLT-compatible
 patterns, and the actions are Java methods.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with SAX, some of the differences in SAXON are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can provide a separate handler for each element type (or other node),
     making your application more modular </li>
  <li>SAXON supplies context information to your application, so you can find out, for
    example, the parent element of the one you are currently processing </li>
  <li>SAXON provides facilities for organizing the output of your application, allowing you to
    direct different parts of the output to different files. SAXON is a particularly
    convenient tool for splitting a large document into page-sized chunks for viewing, or into
    individual records for storing in a relational or object database.</li>
  <li>SAXON allows you to register your preferred SAX-compliant XML parser; you do not need to
    hard-code the name of the parser into your application or supply it each time on the
    command line. SAXON also works with several DOM implementations.</li>
  <li>SAXON extends the SAX InputSource class allowing you to specify a file name as the
    source of input. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Serial and Direct processing: preview mode</h3>

<p><i>An earlier release of SAXON allowed a purely serial mode of processing: each node
was processed as it was encountered. With experience, this proved too restrictive, and caused
the internal architecture to become too complex, so it was withdrawn. It has been replaced with
a new facility, <b>preview mode</b>. This is available both with XSL and with the Java API.</i></p>

<p>Preview mode is useful where the document is too large to fit comfortably in main memory. It
allows you to define node handlers that are called as the document tree is being built in memory,
rather than waiting until the tree is fully built which is the normal case.</p>

<p>When you define an element as a preview element (using the setPreviewElement() method of the
PreviewManager class), its node handler is called as soon as the element end tag is encountered. When the node handler returns control
to SAXON, the children of the preview element are discarded from memory.</p>

<p>This means, for example, that if your large XML document consists of a large number of chapters,
you can process each chapter as it is read, and the memory available needs to be enough only for
 (a) the largest individual chapter, and (b) the top-level structure identifying the list of chapters.</P

<p>When the document tree has been fully built, the node handler for its root element will be called
in the normal way.</p>

<a NAME="Structure">
<h2>Structure</h2>
</a>

<p>Processing is controlled by a class called the Controller. Some of the functions of this class are
relevant only to XSLT transformation, but most can also be used when Saxon is used purely from Java.
Each application run must instantiate a new Controller.</p>

<p>There are several classes used to define the kind of processing you want to perform. These
are the RuleManager for registering template rules, the KeyManager for registering key definitions,
the PreviewManager for registering preview elements, the Stripper for registering which elements
are to have whitespace nodes stripped, and the DecimalFormatManager for registering named decimal
formats. These classes can all be reused freely, and they are thread safe once the definitions
have been set up. All of these objects are registered with the Controller using methods such as
setRuleManager() and setKeyManager().</p>

<p>The Builder class is used to build a document tree from a SAX InputSource. Its main method
 is build(). The builder can be serially reused to build further documents, but it should only be
 used for one document at a time. The builder needs to know about the Stripper if whitespace nodes
 are to be stripped from the tree, and it needs to know about the PreviewManager if any elements
 are to be processed in preview mode. The relevant classes can be registered with the builder using
 the setStripper() and setPreviewManager() methods.</p>

 <p>The Controller class is used to process a document tree by applying registered node handlers.
 Its main method is run(). The controller is responsible for navigating through the
document and calling user-defined handlers which you associate with each element or other node
type to define how it is to be processed. The controller can also be serially reused, but should not be used to
 process more than one document at a time. The Controller needs to know about the RuleManager to
 find the relevant node handlers to invoke. If keys are used it will need to know about the
 KeyManager, and if decimal formats are used it will need to know about the DecimalFormatManager.
 These classes can be registered with the Controller using setRuleManager(), setKeyManager(), and
 setDecimalFormatManager() respectively. If preview mode is used, the PreviewManager will need
 to know about the Controller, so it has a setController() method for this purpose.</p>

<p>Node handlers are called to process each node, in the same way as template rules are used
in XSLT.
They node handler can choose whether or not subsidiary elements should
be processed (by calling applyTemplates()), and can
dive off into a completely different part of the document tree before resuming. A user-written
node handler must implement the NodeHandler interface; for convenience and compatibility with
previous releases, the classes ElementHandler and ElementHandlerBase are also provided.</p>

<p>A node handler can write to the current output destination.
The controller maintains a stack of outputters. Your node handler can switch
output to a new destination by calling setOutputDetails(), and can revert to the prevoius
destination by calling resetOutputDetails(). This is useful both for splitting an input XML
document into multiple XML documents, and for creating output fragments that can be
reassembled in a different order for display. Details of the output format required must be
set up in an OutputDetails object, which is supplied as a parameter to setOutputDetails().
The actual control of output destinations rests with a class called the OutputManager, but
you will normally interact with this via wrapper methods in the Controller.</p>

<a NAME="Parser">
<h2>Choosing a SAX Parser</h2>
</a>

<p>SAXON provides a layer of services on top of a SAX-compliant XML parser. It will work
with any Java-based XML parser that implements
 the <a HREF="http://www.megginson.com/SAX/index.html">SAX1 or SAX2</a> interface.</p>

<p>SAXON uses the configuration file <code>ParserManager.properties</code> to decide which
SAX parser to use. This file identifies a default parser and a list of alternatives. As
issued, it lists some popular (and free) SAX-compliant parsers which have been tested with
SAXON. The default is a version of the AElfred parser which is bundled with SAXON.
If you want to specify a different parser, or change the default,
simply edit the ParserManager.properties file.</p>

<p>If you want to use different parsers depending on the URI of the document being read,
you can achieve this by writing a URIResolver that nominates the parser to be used for each
input file.</p>

<h2><a NAME="Controller">The Controller and Builder</a></h2>

<p>A simple application proceeds as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create an instance of the RuleManager.</li>
<li>Define a number of node handlers using the setHandler() method of the RuleManager class.</li>
<li>Create an instance of the Controller.</li>
<li>Register the node handlers with the Controller using the setRuleManager() method.</li>
<li>Create an instance of the Builder.</li>
<li>Supply an input XML document to build a document tree using the build() method of the
Builder class. This returns a DocumentInfo object</li>
<li>Supply this DocumentInfo object to the run() method of the Controller class.
This will start processing at the root node, calling your node handlers as appropriate.</li>
</ol>


<a NAME="ElementHandler">
<h2>Writing an Element Handler</h2>
</a>

<p>An element handler is one kind of <i>NodeHandler</i>. We focus here on handlers for elements
rather than other kinds of node, because they are the most common.</p>

<p>User-written element-handlers are written to implement the interface ElementHandler.
 Optionally, you can define them as subclasses of the system-supplied class ElementHandlerBase,
  an element handler that does nothing.</p>

<p>Always remember that if you want child elements to be processed recursively, your
element handler must call the applyTemplates() method.</p>

<p>The element handler is supplied with an ElementInfo object which provides information
about the current element, and with a Context object that gives access to a range of standard services
such an Outputter object which includes a write() method to produce output.</p>

<p>Normally you will write one element handler for each type of element, but it is quite
possible to use the same handler for several different elements. You can also write
completely general-purpose handlers. You define which elements will be handled by each
element handler using a pattern, exactly as in XSLT.</p>

<p>You only need to provide one method for the selected element type. This is:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP" width="25%">startElement()</td>
    <td>This is called when the start of the element is encountered. The ElementInfo object
    passed gives you information about the element and it attributes. You can save information
    for later use if required, using one of several techniques: <ul>
      <li>The setUserData() interface in the Controller object allows you to associate arbitrary
        information with any node in the source document. This is useful if you are building up an object model from the XML document, and
        you want to link XML elements to objects in your model.  </li>
      <li>You can save information in local variables within the element handler object:
        but take care not to do this if the same element handler might
      be used to process another element before the first one ends.</li>
      <li>Finally, you can create XSL variables using the Context object. These variables are visible
      only within the current element handler, but the ability to reference them in XSL expressions
      gives added flexibility. For example, you can set up a variable which is then used in a filter
      in the expression passed to applyTemplates(), which thus controls which child nodes will be
      processed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

<a NAME="Patterns">
<h2>Patterns and Expressions</h2>
</a>

<p>Patterns are used in the setHandler() interface to define which
nodes a particular handler applies to. Expressions are used in the applyTemplates()
interface to control which nodes are selected for processing. Patterns and expressions
used in the SAXON Java API have exactly the same form as in XSLT.</p>


<p>The detailed rules for patterns can be found in <a href=patterns.html>patterns.html</a>,
and for expressions in <a href=expressions.html>expressions.html</a></p>

<p>Expressions and Patterns are represented in the API by classes Expression and Pattern
respectively. These include static methods to create an Expression or Pattern from a String.
A few convenience methods also allow Expressions and Patterns to be supplied directly as
Strings.</p>

<p>When you create an Expression or Pattern using the methods Expression.make() and Pattern.make()
you may supply a StaticContext object. This object provides the information needed to interpret
certain expressions and patterns: for example, it provides the ability to convert a namespace
prefix within the expressions into a URI. In an XSLT stylesheet, the StaticContext provides information
the expression can get from the rest of the stylesheet; in a Java application, this is not available,
so you must provide the context yourself. If you don't supply a StaticContext object, a default context
is used: this will prevent you using context-dependent constructs such as variables and namespace prefixes.

<hr>

<a NAME="ElementInfo">
<h2>The ElementInfo Object</h2>
</a>

<p>The ElementInfo object represents an element node of the XML document (that is, a construct
with a start and end tag). It is a subclass of NodeInfo, which represents a general Node. The
Saxon classes such as NodeInfo and ElementInfo correspond to the DOM classes Node and Element,
but with many additional methods provided.</p>

<p>The main purpose of the ElementInfo object is to provide element handlers with
information about the element. The most commonly-used methods include:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="30%">getName()</td>
    <td>get the name of the element, as a Name object. You can use the Name object to
        get the local part of the name, the prefix, or the URI of the namespace.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP">getAttributeValue()</td>
    <td>get the value of a specified attribute, as a String.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP">getInheritedAttribute()</td>
    <td>get the value of an inherited attribute, as a String. This is useful for attributes
    that are implicitly inherited by child elements from their parent elements (for example
    the xml:space attribute). It returns the first value of the attribute found on any
    enclosing element, starting the search at the current element.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP">getParentNode()</td>
    <td>get the ElementInfo of the parent element, or the DocumentInfo object if this is the
    outermost element. Note that if you frequently need to take
    different action depending on the parent element type, it may be better to provide
    separate handlers for the element depending on the context it appears in.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP">getAncestor()</td>
    <td>get the nearest ancestor matching a given pattern.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP">getDocumentElement()</td>
    <td>get the outermost element of the document (<i>not</i> the Document node).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP">getPreviousSibling()</td>
    <td>get the ElementInfo for the previous element at the same level. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP">getNextSibling()</td>
    <td>get the ElementInfo for the next element at the same level.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
