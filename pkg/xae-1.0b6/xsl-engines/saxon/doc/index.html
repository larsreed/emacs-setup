<h2>What is SAXON?</h2>
</a>

<p>The SAXON package is a collection of tools for processing XML documents. The main components
are: </p>

<ul>
<li>An XSLT processor, which implements the 
Version 1.0 XSLT and XPath Recommendations from the World Wide Web Consortium, found at
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116">
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116</a> and
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116">
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116</a>
with a number of powerful extensions</li>

<li>A Java library, which supports a similar processing model to XSL, but allows full programming
 capability, which you need if you want to perform complex processing of the data or to access
 external services such as a relational database</li>

<li>A slightly improved version of the &AElig;lfred parser from
<a href="http://www.microstar.com">Microstar</a>. (But you can use SAXON with any
 SAX-compliant XML parser if you prefer).</li>
</ul>

<p>So you can use SAXON by writing XSL stylesheets, 
by writing Java applications, or by any combination of the two.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0080">If you are only interested in running the XSLT interpreter, on a
Windows platform, try <a href="instant.html">Instant
SAXON</a>. </font> At 300 Kb, this is a much smaller download; it excludes source code and API
documentation.</p>

<p>SAXON provides a set of services that are particularly useful when converting XML data into
other formats. The output format may be XML, or HTML, or some other format such as comma separated
values, EDI messages, or data in a relational database.</p>

<p>SAXON implements the XSLT 1.0 recommendation, including XPath 1.0, in its entirety.
SAXON also does things 
that are beyond the scope of the XSL standard: for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It allows XSL processing and Java processing to be freely mixed, so you can always
    escape into procedural code to do something non-standard (such as accessing a database)</li>
    
  <li>It allows multiple output files. SAXON is particularly useful for splitting a large
    document into page-sized chunks. You can do this without writing any Java code.</li>

  <li>It allows multi-pass processing, by means of an extension function that converts a result
  tree fragment to a nodeset, or by chaining stylesheets together</li>

  <li>It allows variables to be updated.</li>
  

</ul>

<p>As a class library, SAXON gives you the ability to use the XSL rule-based approach to
document processing, but with the flexibility of the full Java language. You can declare
handler classes to match particular patterns in the document, and can process arbitrary
sets of nodes selected using XSL expressions. This provides a high-level query capability which
you can mix with purely navigational access.</p>

<h2><a NAME="Historical">Historical Note</a></h2>

<p>I originally wrote SAXON to support an internal project in <a HREF="http://www.icl.com">ICL</a>.
It has since been used for a number of external projects, but there is no intent to make it into
a fully-fledged ICL product.</p>

<p>The name SAXON was chosen because originally it was a layer on top of SAX. Also, it uses
the Ælfred parser (among others); Ælfred of course was a Saxon king...</p>

<p><small>I have been asked to point out that the product has no connection with a company
called <strong>SAXON Software</strong>. </small></p>

<hr>
<p>Please read the <a href="conditions.html">Conditions of Use</a>.</p>

<hr>
<a NAME="Support"><h2>Technical Support</h2></a>

<p>Saxon comes with no warranty and no formal technical support service.</p>

<p>If you have questions, however, you can usually get an answer by raising them on the Saxon
discussion list at <a href="http://saxon.xsl.listbot.com">http://saxon.xsl.listbot.com</a>.
Also check the list archives: I post lists of known errors there from time to time.
If the query relates to the XSLT/XPath language rather than Saxon itself, it is better to use
 the <a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/xsl/xsl-list/">XSL-list</a>: check first that the query
 isn't already covered in the FAQ. Another useful site for XSLT information is
 <a href="http://www.xslinfo.com">www.xslinfo.com</a></p>

<A name="Installation"><h2>Installation</h2></a>

<p><font color="#FF0080">Existing users please see the file <a href=changes.html>changes.html</a> for
details of any incompatible changes.</font></p>

<p>The full SAXON distribution includes source and object code,
 documentation, and <a HREF="samples.html">sample applications</a>.</p>

<p>Object code is issued as a JAR file, <b>saxon.jar</b>, which you must include on your class path.

<p>Saxon includes a built-in XML parser, but you can use it with a different XML
parser if you wish. To do this, the file <b>ParserManager.properties</b> must be copied into a directory that is listed on your CLASSPATH.
You should edit this file to identify the SAX-compliant parser that you intend to use.</p>

<p>User documentation, covering both the XSLT and Java interfaces, is included in the download in the form
 of extensive javadoc specifications. Be sure to read the package summaries, which give an overview
 in the form of a user guide.
In addition there is an <a href="api-guide.html">introductory overview</a>.</p>


<h3>Prerequisites</b>:</h3>

<p>The following software must be installed separately, it is not included with the SAXON download.</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Java development environment. SAXON has been tested with both SUN's and
    Microsoft's Java compilers and VMs. The latest version was compiled using Java 2. It
    will run under JDK 1.1; however, the source will no longer compile under JDK 1.1.</li>
  <li>SAXON has an option to pass the result tree to Apache's <a href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/">FOP
   processor</a>, which is capable of generating output in PDF. <i>Integration with FOP
   is currently broken, because of inadequacies in the support for SAX2 in FOP 0_14_0. It will
   be fixed with a future version of FOP.</i></li> 
</ul>

<p>SAXON now comes with a bundled XML parser, a modified copy of the
 <a href="http://www.microstar.com">AElfred</a> parser, adapted to
notify comments to the application. It can be used with other SAX-compliant parsers by modifying
the ParserManager.properties file. SAXON has been tested successfully in the past with 
 Lark, MSXML, SUN Project X, Oracle XML, xerces, xml4j, and xp. Use of a SAX2-compliant
 parser is preferred, as SAX1 does not allow XML comments to be passed to the application.
 However, SAXON works with either.
 All the relevant classes must be installed on your Java CLASSPATH.</p>

<p>An interactive debugger for Saxon has been written by
 <a href="mailto:edwin@pannenleiter.de">Edwin Glaser</a>. It is still at an
 early stage of development. The software can be downloaded from
  <a href="http://tbug.sourceforge.net"/>http://tbug.sourceforge.net</a>. It is
  issued in tar/gzip format, but it can be unpacked on a Windows machine using WinZIP.</p>

<p>Because Saxon is run from the command line, you might find it useful (under Microsoft Windows)
 to have a text editor
with better command-line support than the standard DOS window. I use <b>Programmer's File Editor (PFE)</b>,
a free product available from a number of download sites, for example
<a href="http://cdnet.softseek.com/Programming/Editors/Review_22841_index.html">softseek.com</a>.</p>
