Standards Conformance</font></b></p>

<h2>XSLT and XPath conformance</h2>

<p><i>SAXON XSLT implements the
XSLT 1.0 and XPath 1.0 Recommendations from the World Wide Web Consortium, found at
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116">
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116</a> and
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116">
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116</a>, which are 
referred to here collectively as "XSLT"</i></p>

<p>SAXON is 100% conformant to the mandatory requirements of these standards, with the qualifications
noted below.</p>

<p>SAXON will automatically convert a result tree fragment to a node-set when required. This is
a technical breach of the XSLT 1.0 specification, provided in the interests of portability with
MSXML3, and in anticipation of features expected to be introduced in XSLT 1.1</p>

<p>SAXON is dependant on the user-selected XML parser to ensure conformance with the XML 1.0
Recommendation. However, SAXON itself ensures that the source document and stylesheet comply
with the XML Namespaces Recommendation.</p>

<p>SAXON implements the &lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt; processing instruction in a source
XML document provided that the pseudo-attribute <b>href</b> is either the URL of a freestanding
stylesheet document, or a fragment identifier matching the id attribute of an embedded stylesheet
within the same document. Java APIs are available allowing the application to implement more
elaborate schemes of stylesheet addressing than this, including the ability to access an embedded
stylesheet by means other than the &lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt; processing instruction.</p>


<hr>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<ul>

<li>&lt;xsl:number&gt; is not supported on attribute or namespace nodes.</li>

<li><p>Comment nodes in the input document can be processed only if SAX2-compliant parser
is used. If a SAX1 parser is chosen instead, comments are silently ignored.</p></li>

<li><p>SAXON supports language-dependent sorting and numbering only for English, but offers
APIs that allow support of other languages via user-written additions.</p></li> 


</ul>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>The XSLT specification says that the documentation for an implementation should specify which URI schemes
are supported. SAXON supports the URI scheme implemented by the Java java.net.URL class. Additionally,
SAXON allows the user to nominate a URIResolver class which can be used to implement any URI scheme
the user wants.</p>

<p>The XSLT specification says that the documentation for an implementation should specify for which
media types fragment identifiers are supported. SAXON does not support fragment identifiers for any
media type. However, a user-written URIResolver can support fragment identifiers if it wishes.</p>

<p>The values of the vendor-specific system properties are:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>version</td><td>1.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>vendor</td><td>SAXON from Michael Kay of ICL</td></tr>
<tr><td>vendor-url</td><td>http://users.iclway.co.uk/mhkay/saxon/index.html</td></tr>
</table>

<p>All three values are subject to change in future releases. Users wishing to test whether the
processor is SAXON are advised to test whether the vendor system property starts with the string
"SAXON".</p>

<h3>Extensions</h3>

<p>SAXON implements a number of extensions to standard XSLT, following the rules for extension
functions and extension elements where appropriate. The extensions are documented in
<a href="extensions.html">extensions.html</a>. They are all implemented in accordance with
the provisions in the standard for extensibility.</p>

<h2>DOM Conformance</h2>

<p>SAXON accepts input (both source document and stylesheet) from any standards-compliant DOM
implementation.</p>

<p>SAXON allows the result tree to be attached to any Document or Element node of an existing
DOM. Any DOM implementation can be used, provided it is mutable.</p>

<p>SAXON's internal tree structure (which is visible through the Java API, including the case
where Java extensions functions are called from XPath expressions) conforms with the minimal
requirements of the DOM level 2 core Java language binding. This DOM interface is read-only,
so all attempts to call updating methods throw an appropriate DOM exception. No optional
features are implemented.</p>

<p>If an extension function returns a DOM Node or NodeList, this must consist only of Nodes
in a tree constructed using Saxon. Since Saxon's trees cannot be updated using DOM methods, this
means that the nodes returned must either be nodes from the original source tree, or nodes from
a tree constructed using Saxon's proprietary API.</p>

<h2>TrAX Conformance</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://trax.openxml.org/">TrAX interface</a> is not yet stable, but Saxon
incudes a partial implementation of the interface in its current form for experimental use.</p>

<p>To avoid any confusion as TrAX evolves, I have used the interim package names
 com.icl.saxon.trax and com.icl.saxon.trax.serialize. The interface definitions are based on
 TrAX version 0.6, but with some changes which I have proposed for inclusion in a future
 version of TrAX.</p>

<p>TrAX features not yet implemented include:</p>

<ul>
<li>&lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt;: use of the "alternate" pseudo-attribute</li>
<li>Transforming a node of a DOM document other than the Document node</li>
</ul>

<p>Saxon acts as a TrAX Processor, but it does not currently provide a TrAX Serializer, nor
does it work with third-party TrAX Serializers.</p>


<a name="errorrecovery"><h2>Error recovery policy</h2></a>

<p>Where the XSLT specification requires that an error be signaled, Saxon produces an error
message and terminates stylesheet execution.</p>

<p>Where the XSLT specification states that the processor may recover from an error, Saxon takes
one of three actions as described in the table below. Either it signals the error and terminates
execution, or it recovers silently from the error in the manner permitted by the specification,
or it places the action under user control. In the latter case there are three options: report the
error and terminate, recover silently, or (the default) recover after writing a warning
 to the system error output stream.</p>

<p>Handling of individual recoverable errors is described in the table below.</p>

<table>
<tr><td><b>Error</b></td><td><b>Action</b></td></tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">There is more than one template rule that matches a node, with the
same import precedence and priority</td>
