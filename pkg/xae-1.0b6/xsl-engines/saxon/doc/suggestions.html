<p>This page acts as a register of suggestions or ideas for future enhancements
to Saxon, or notes of current restrictions. There is no implication that any of these
will ever be implemented, although any developer who wants to take any of them on is
welcome to contact me.</p>

<p>To add your own suggestions to the list, email
 <a href="mailto:Michael.Kay@icl.com">Michael Kay</a>. Ideas will
 only be added if I consider the enhancement desirable, and even then
 there is no promise of action.</p>

    <TD vAlign="top">Norm Walsh suggests that as the Saxon transform operates as a SAX2
    filter, any user-supplied entity resolver ought to be used to resolve the URIs in
    (for example) the document() function, or xsl:include and xsl:import</TD>
    <TD valign="top">Under consideration</TD></TR>

    <td valign="top">2</td>
    <TD vAlign="top">As the Saxon transform operates as a SAX2
    filter, any user-supplied SAX error handler ought to be notified of errors occurring
    during the transformation</TD>
    <TD valign="top">Almost a bug</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <td valign="top">3</td>
    <TD vAlign="top">An output writer supplied to receive output of the transformation ought
    to be closed by the user, not by Saxon.</TD>
    <TD valign="top">This area has caused some difficulty, there are different use cases and it's hard
    to get it right for all of them.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <td valign="top">4</td>
    <TD vAlign="top">Implement JavaScript extension functions</TD>
    <TD valign="top">Not urgent</TD></TR>
  <TR>

    <TD vAlign="top">Change saxon:output to generate the output file relative to the base URI rather than
    the current directory.</TD>
    <TD valign="top">Not urgent. See what XSLT 1.1 says about it.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <td valign="top">7</td>
    <TD vAlign="top">Provide extension functions to invoke regular expressions.</TD>
    <TD valign="top">Not urgent.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <td valign="top">8</td>
    <TD vAlign="top">Restriction: if the same document is kept in memory, and several transforms
    are applied using it as input, there may be conflicts if the space-stripping rules in the different stylesheets are incompatible.</TD>
    <TD valign="top">Difficult to fix, user workarounds are possible.</TD></TR>    
  <TR>
    <td valign="top">9</td>
    <TD vAlign="top">Implement a richer set of international collating and numbering rules</TD>
    <TD valign="top">Not urgent. Some progress made on numbering.</TD></TR>    
  <TR>
    <td valign="top">10</td>
    <TD vAlign="top">Add an extension that allows creation of entity declarations in the internal
    DTD subset of the result document (the specific request was for unparsed entity declarations).</TD>
    <TD valign="top">Nice idea.</TD></TR>
